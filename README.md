# Data types
This is an arbitrary set of objects representing some kind of data with the intention of extending and enriching them.
I am using these datatypes in some projects so another goal is interoperability and the possibility of versioning. This
initial version does not contain a lot of exciting stuff but you have to start somewhere.
