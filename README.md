# Data types
This is an arbitrary set of objects representing some kind of data with the intention of extending and enriching them.
Mostly for private projects but i would love to see other people make use of them and improve them.

## Not much
At the moment there are not that many datatypes and hardly any validations. There are probably hundreds of better 
solutions but this suits me perfect. The main reason for using these types is to act as a contract between REST api's 
with other developers. This way it is clear what data is compatible and what not.
